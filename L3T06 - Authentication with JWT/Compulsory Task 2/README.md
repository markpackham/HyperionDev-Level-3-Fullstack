# JMT Learning

It includes the following:

- Body-Parser to parse the body of a request
- Concurrently so a simple "npm start" will install all modules and run the app at the same time
- Express to run as the backend server
- Jsonwebtoken to identify users and their access rights
- Nodemon to save the dev from having to constantly restart the server after changes


## App Purpose

Demo use of JMT with user logins via POST
Demo use of JMT dealing with regular user and admin user GET requests for resources.


## Requirements

Code was written in Node.JS version 21. Node should be at the very least version 18.

It is advised to test the code via Postman since a frontend does not exist.
The folder "Screenshots and Notes" has screenshots of example Postman requests.
It also has a file giving examples of what JWT look like.


## Check node version

```
node --version
```

### Install Dependencies & Run

```
npm start
```
